<b>PC Disposal:</b>
<p>In business, you need to stay ahead of the competition. Faster PCs, improved monitors and enhanced printers are a necessity to gain competitive advantages. Refreshing desktop infrastructure, results in an inventory of older PC hardware. Therefore, old equipment gets pushed aside in cubicles, offices or illegally thrown away. This can result in valuable space being unused, or possible sanctions levied by the EPA.
